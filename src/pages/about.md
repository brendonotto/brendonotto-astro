I've been a software engineer for 12 years working mainly in .NET, SQL and JavaScript. 

Technologies I play with outside of work are Elixir, Rust and the occassional front end framework. 

When not in front of a computer I enjoy being outside taking hikes or geocaching with my family. I also enjoy making things with wood and 3d printing balancing making things with my hands and digitally.
